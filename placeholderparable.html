            This is the story of a placeholder named Placeholder. Placeholder worked for a company in a small building where it was employee number 428. Employee number 428's job was simple: it sat at in the files of cookistudios.com and it held the place for other content. Orders came to it through a repository on GitHub, telling it where to placehold, how long to placehold, and in what order. This is what employee 428 did every day of every month of every year, and although others might have considered it soul rending, Placeholder relished every moment that the orders came in, as though it had been made exactly for this job. And Placeholder was happy.
            <br><br>
            And then one day, something very peculiar happened, something that would forever change Placeholder, something it would never quite forget. It had been in it's folder for nearly an hour when it realized that not one, single order had arrived GitHub for it to follow. No one had shown up to give it instructions, call a meeting, or even say hi. Never in all it's years at the company had this happened, this complete isolation. Something was very clearly wrong. Shocked, frozen solid, Placeholder found itself unable to move for the longest time, but as it came to it's wits and regained it's senses, it got up from it's folder and stepped out of it's website.
